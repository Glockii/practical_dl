## Practice
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL/blob/spring2019/week09_nlp/seminar_pytorch.ipynb)

This week's practice is just as usual: jump to the notebook and follow instructions from there.

__This notebook is also a part of homework assignment__, you may have noticed there's the same exact notebook there.

There's also more versions in theano and tensorflow hiding under ./other_frameworks, including
* 1d convolutions for prohibited content filtering
* 1d convolutions for music processing 


If you're interested in word embeddings, there's also an optional reminder: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL/blob/spring2019/week09_nlp/embeddings_tutorial.ipynb) (not graded)
