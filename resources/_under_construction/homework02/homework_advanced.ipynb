    "When training large models, it is usually a best practice not to use Jupyter notebooks, but run a **separate script** for training which could have command-line flags for various hyperparameters and training modes. This is especially useful when you need to run multiple experiments simultaneously (e.g. on a cluster with task scheduler). Another advantage of this is that after training, the process will finish and free the resources for other users of a shared GPU.\n",
