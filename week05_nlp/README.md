## Practice

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL/blob/fall19/week05_nlp/seminar.ipynb)

This week's practice is just as usual: jump to the notebook and follow instructions from there.

__This notebook is also a part of homework assignment__, you may have noticed there's the same exact notebook there.

There are versions in pytorch, theano and tensorflow.

You can also find under `1d_conv_tasks` the following alternative assiments in theano:
* 1d convolutions for prohibited content filtering
* 1d convolutions for music processing
